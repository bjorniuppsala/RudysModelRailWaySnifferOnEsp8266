# RudysModelRailWaySnifferOnEsp8266
Rudys model railway DCC sniffer on platformio/esp8266


Stolen from https://rudysmodelrailway.wordpress.com/2015/10/23/dcc-sniffer-packet-analyser-with-arduino/
and tweaked to run on a lolin nodemcu with a esp8266 chip.

No networking yet though. Would be nice with a web/telnet interface!
